# Building-Neural-Network

In this exercise, we implemented a fully connected neural network with 3 layers to the task of brain MRI voxels classification, when voxel can belong or not to multiple sclerosis lesion .  The project was done in 'Image Processing 2' course and it included elements of forward and back propagation , hyper-parameter tuning and validation using loss and accuracy parameters.
